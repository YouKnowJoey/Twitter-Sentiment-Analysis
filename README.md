# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
Process open-source data using libraries such as "tweepy" (Twitter API for user authentication). What I'm especially interested in seeing is which model (Random Forest, Log. Rregression, etc. ) performs the best. I'm curious to see how incorporating my own PIpelines and seeing how adjusting volume of data throughput effects the performance metrics.
