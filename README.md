# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
>This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract and classify the emotional tone of social media text data. We will analyze sentiment of tweets sourced from X (formerly Twitter) using machine learning. It leverages the Sentiment140 dataset, imported via TensorFlow Datasets, as the training and testing source. Real-time tweets are retrieved using the Tweepy library with authenticated access to the Twitter API.
>
>The goal is to evaluate the performance of various classification models — including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and others — to determine which performs best for sentiment classification tasks.
>
>**The reproducibility of this project will be in the form of a Docker file.**
